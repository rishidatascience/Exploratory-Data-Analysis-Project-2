# Question 3:
# Of the four types of sources indicated by the type (point, nonpoint, onroad,
# nonroad) variable, which of these four sources have seen decreases in
# emissions from 1999–2008 for Baltimore City? Which have seen increases in
# emissions from 1999–2008? Use the ggplot2 plotting system to make a plot
# answer this question.
